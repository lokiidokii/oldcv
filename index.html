  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I started my journey into tech as a Digital Media Specialist. Working for a small, full-service advertising agency out of Dayton, OH, I was thrust into the world of website design and development due to the limited number of associates in our
    agency. Because of our agency size, many of us were expected to cross-train and pick up various types of new skills. <br><br>At first, it was quite daunting. I lacked a lot of the technical skills and knowledge I needed for the tasks I was
    assigned. But the moment I finished designing and creating my first website project for a client in my first few weeks of employment, I realized web development was exactly the right path for me. It created an unquenchable thrist in me to learn
    as much as I could. And so I did. After a year of employment as a Digital Marketing Specialist, I requested and was granted an internal transition over to become a Front-End Web Developer for our agency. <br> <br>Much of what I've worked on and
    learned has been self-taught. I did take a couple of computer science courses in college while working on my degree in Anthropology, including an Intro to Java Programming course. Unfortunately, by the time I realized my love for computer science
    at that point in university, my government tuition assistance was about to run out and I needed to graduate with my first bachelors degree. I was already so far into my Antrhopology degree that I decided to finish it before continuing my
    education further.<br><br> After that, I made the decision to stay dedicated and consistent with my personal studies, using a variety of online resources to help myself learn and grow as a web developer. It hasn't been easy at times, but Google,
    stackoverflow.com, Reddit, MeetUp, and the assistance of some wonderful mentors have definitely helped when I've gotten stuck and needed to step away from a problem myself to find a solution.<br><br>One of the other resources I decided to use in
    my training was a Web Development Bootcamp, which is where this particular project stems from. This (what you're looking at right now) is an example of my ability to create a basic website using HTML.</p>
